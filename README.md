This action is a GitHub Action that uses the AI to automatically review your pull request. You need to have OPENAI_API_KEY in your secrets to use this action.

### How to use? ðŸš€

- Obtain your OpenAI API key. You can get it from the OpenAI dashboard [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to your repository secrets. Go to your repository settings, then secrets, and add a new secret with the name `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the value of your OpenAI API key. Steps: [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository)
